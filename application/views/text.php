Skyscanner is a leading global travel search site, a place where people are inspired to plan and book direct from millions of travel options at the best prices.

We are unbiased and free, which means that the 60 million people who use us every month can trust our comprehensive range of flight, hotel and car hire options.

Our secret is in our unique proprietary technology that connects people directly to everything the travel industry has to offer. We also power travel search for over 1200 partners through our Skyscanner for Business products.

Our highly-rated free mobile app has been downloaded over 70 million times. We're global but local and our products are available in over 30 languages and 70 currencies.

Founded in 2003, we employ over 900 staff, with offices in Barcelona, Beijing, Budapest, Edinburgh, Glasgow, London, Miami, Shenzhen, Singapore and Sofia. Skyscanner is part of the Ctrip group.

Skyscanner is always free for travellers and we never charge travellers commission. We work with our airline and online travel agent partners in a number of ways: some partners agree to give Skyscanner a commission for every booking made through us or for every time travellers visit a partner’s website. Other partners advertise on the Skyscanner website and app. We always make sure any adverts are labelled or separate from any search results so users know exactly what’s what.
